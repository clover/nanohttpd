This is a fork of: https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd

This fork adds the branch `nanohttpd-project-2.3.1.1`, based the upstream tag `nanohttpd-project-2.3.1` which fixes an Android closeguard warning that occurs handling GZIP encoding and updates the version to 2.3.1.1.

Version 2.3.1.1 is deployed to Clovers artifactory here: https://artifactory.corp.clover.com/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/libs-release-local/org/nanohttpd/nanohttpd/2.3.1.1/nanohttpd-2.3.1.1.jar. There is no automated way to deploy this repository to artifactory. It must be built and deployed manually.
